# Kmeans-Clustering-Unsupervised-ML-model-on-abalone
In this Project,Unsupervised Machine learning algorithm is applied to make clusters of sex present in abolone marine gastropod molluscs. Kmeans clustering technique is used to form clusters of sex classes to identify how many sex classes present in abalone family. 
# K-Means Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique. It is the process of division of the dataset into groups in which the members in the same group possess similarities in features.
It is the simplest and commonly used iterative type unsupervised learning algorithm. In this, we randomly initialize the K number of centroids in the data (the number of k is found using the Elbow method) and iterates these centroids until no change happens to the position of the centroid.

# Abalone Data set
Abalones are marine snails. Their taxonomy puts them in the family Haliotidae.The Abalone Dataset was originally published at the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone.
The Abalone Dataset is composed of the following attributes:

- Sex	nominal	-	M, F, and I (infant)
- Length- Longest shell measurement
- Diameter- perpendicular to length
- Height- with meat in shell
- Whole weight- whole abalone
- Shucked weight- weight of meat
- Viscera weight- gut weight (after bleeding)
- Shell weight- after being dried
- Rings	-+1.5 gives the age in years
